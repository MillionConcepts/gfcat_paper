Flare Table : gfcat_flare_table.csv

The GFCAT table of candidate flares contains one row / entry per flare measured in
lightcurves identified as containing flare-like morphology. This table inherits a
large number of columns from the visit-level table, and the definitions for those
columns will be found in gfcat_visit_table_column_defs.txt. The values for fluence
and energy have been scaled by log10, e.g. 10^32 ergs would be recorded as 32.

fluence_NUV : the integrated fluence of the flare in NUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_err_NUV : the error on the integrated fluence of the flare in NUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_FUV : the integrated fluence of the flare in FUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_err_FUV : the error on the integrated fluence of the flare in FUV [ergs / cm^2]
energy_NUV : the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_err_1_NUV : the lower error on the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_err_2_NUV : the upper error on the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_FUV : the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
energy_err_1_FUV : the lower error on the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
energy_err_2_FUV : the upper error on the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
duration : the duration of the flare in seconds
left_censored : a flag indicating whether the flare extent includes the lowest time bin in the observation
right_censored : a flag indicating whether the flare extent includes the highest time bin in the observation
peak_cps_NUV : the counts-per-second of the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve
peak_cps_err_NUV : the counting error on cps of the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve

peak_mag_err_NUV : the error on AB mag of the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve
peak_t0_NUV : the time bin of the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve (in GALEX time)
peak_censored : a flag indicating whether the maximum value in the flare light curve is the earliest or
    latest time bin, suggesting that the peak of the flare was not observed

quiescence_cps_err_NUV : the counting error in cps on the estimated quiescence in NUV
