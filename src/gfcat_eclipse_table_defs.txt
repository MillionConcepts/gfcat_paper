Eclipse Table : gfcat_eclipse_table.csv

The GFCAT table of candidate eclipses contains one row for each lightcurve (source-visit)
manually identified as morphologically consistent with a stellar eclipse. Its contents 
are a strict subset of the rows of the GFCAT visit-level table, so all column definitions 
can be found in gfcat_visit_table_defs.txt.
