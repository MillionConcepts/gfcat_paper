lightcurve files
These files provide lightcurves for all source-visits included in GFCAT, organized by GALEX eclipse number, band, and aperture size. The file naming convention is: 


e{eclipse}-{band}d-30s-photom-{size}.csv


* eclipse is 0-padded 5-digit GALEX eclipse number
* band is ‘n’ for NUV, and ‘f’ for FUV
* size is aperture size used to generate lightcurves in this file, given in arcseconds. If a decimal point would be present, it is replaced by an underscore.


example: e07500-fd-30s-photom-17_5.csv contains FUV lightcurves for the three GFCAT sources observed in GALEX eclipse 7500, generated using apertures of 17.5”.


format: Lightcurve files are ASCII comma-separated value (CSV) files, row-delimited by line-feed (\n) characters. They have a single header row with column names, followed by one or more rows corresponding to each GFCAT source observed during that GALEX eclipse. The columns of each file are:


* ra: source right ascension (J2000 ICRS). For sources algorithmically detected by DAOPHOT, this value is computed from the WCS of the full-depth visit image by applying wcslib’s pix2world function to the aperture center (columns ‘xcenter’ & ‘ycenter’) used to compute photometry. For sources found by targeted search on a preexisting catalog, this value is directly propagated from that catalog. 
* dec: source declination (J2000 ICRS). Provenance is the same as ra.
* xcentroid: x position of source centroid, in image coordinates. For sources algorithmically detected by DAOPHOT, this is the value reported by DAOPHOT. For sources found by targeted search on a preexisting catalog, this value is computed from the WCS of the full-depth visit image by applying wcslib’s world2pix function to the ra/dec values propagated from that catalog.
* ycentroid: y position of source centroid, in image coordinates. Provenance is the same as xcentroid.
* xcenter: x position of aperture center, in image coordinates. This value is directly propagated from the output of photutils.aperture_photometry. This is identical to xcentroid in most cases.
* xcenter: y position of aperture center, in image coordinates. This value is directly propagated from the output of photutils.aperture_photometry. This is identical to ycentroid in most cases.
* aperture_sum: Calibrated photon count for this source across the entire visit: total counted photons scaled by detector-space-dependent response (and, for photons binned into pixels falling only partially within this aperture, spatial extent).
* aperture_sum_mask: Calibrated photon count for this source across the entire visit, including only photons detected in regions covered by the hotspot mask. For most GFCAT sources, this is 0.
* aperture_sum_edge: Calibrated photon count for this source across the entire visit, including only photons detected in regions falling within the detector edge mask. For most GFCAT sources, this is 0.
* aperture_sum_{N}: Multiple columns, one for each 30-second bin in this lightcurve. Calibrated photon count for this source in bin number N (0-indexed).
* aperture_sum_mask_{N}: Same, for photons falling within the detector hotspot mask.
* aperture_sum_edge_{N}: Same, for photons falling within the detector edge mask.


Note that GALEX eclipse number as specified by the filename, along with ra and dec, can be used as a pivot from lightcurve files to the visit-level GFCAT catalog.

exptime files
These files provide bin positions and corrected exposure times for each GALEX eclipse that contains one or more GFCAT sources. The file naming convention is:


e{eclipse}-nd-30s-exptime.csv, where eclipse is 0-padded 5-digit GALEX eclipse number.


format: Exposure time files are ASCII comma-separated value (CSV) files, row-delimited by line-feed (\n) characters. Each begins with a single header row containing column names, followed by one row for each 30-second bin used to calculate the photometric quantities used in the corresponding GALEX eclipse’s lightcurve files. Columns are:


* index column:  time bin number (0-indexed). Corresponds to bin number {N} in this GALEX eclipse’s lightcurve files.
* expt: effective exposure time in seconds (raw exposure minus deadtime and shutter corrections).
* t0: starting time value of bin in seconds (GALEX global event time scale).
* t1: ending time value of bin in seconds (GALEX global event time scale).


The effective exposure time values in these files may be used to convert the photon counts in their corresponding lightcurve files into flux densities and/or AB magnitudes. The standard conversions are:
* AB Mag = -2.5 * log10(counts / second) + scale. ‘scale’ is 18.82 for FUV and 20.08 for NUV.
* flux density = scale * counts / second. ‘scale’ is 1.4e-15 for FUV and 2.06e-16 for NUV. Units are ergs/(sec * cm^2 * A).


context images
These files provide rich visual representations of photometry and observational context. There is one context image for each source-visit included in GFCAT. The filename convention is:


gfcat_{eclipse}_{visit_table_index}.jpg


* eclipse is 0-padded 5-digit eclipse number
* visit_table_index is row number of this source-visit in the GFCAT visit-level catalog.


The image layout differs depending on whether or not an observation was conducted in both NUV and FUV or only in NUV.


NUV + FUV images
These images have four square image panes above three horizontal line graphs.


The upper-left image pane displays the full-depth NUV image for this GALEX eclipse (in calibrated counts scaled by the zscale algorithm). The x-axis of this pane, labeled ‘galactic longitude’, is RA in J2000 ICRS; the y-axis, labeled ‘galactic latitude’, is DEC in J2000 ICRS. The yellow box in this pane denotes the bounds of the upper-right pane. The red circle within that box denotes the bounds of the apertures used to generate photometry for this source-visit.


The upper-right pane is a detail of the upper-left pane – a square centered on the source, approximately 8 arcminutes on each side. Its axes are also in RA/DEC.  The three red circles overlaid on this image denote 17.5”, 25”, and 35” apertures around the source.


The lower-left and lower-right panes duplicate the format of the upper-left and upper-right panes, but for FUV. Aperture overlays are in blue rather than red to help users distinguish bands at a glance.


The first line graph (counting from the top) displays the NUV lightcurve in red. Its x axis, which is shared with the second and third line graphs, displays seconds from the beginning of the observation. Its y axis is NUV flux density in femtoerg / (sec * cm^2 * A). Error bars denote flux errors at 1 sigma; the shaded region denotes errors at 3 sigma. The dashed horizontal lines mark flux minima and maxima; AB Mag equivalents for these values are given on the right-hand y-axis spine.


The second line graph duplicates this format for the FUV lightcurve in blue.


The third line graph gives FUV/NUV flux ratio (“color”) in black. The error bars and shaded region similarly denote 1-sigma and 3-sigma flux ratio errors for each bin.


NUV-only observations
These images have two square image panes above a single line graph. The left and right panes are the same as the upper-left and upper-right panes in NUV + FUV context images. The line graph is the same as the top line graph in NUV + FUV context images.
[a]is there a pivot in an extended version of the object-level catalog? don't remember.
